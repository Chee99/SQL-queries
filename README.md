# SQL-queries
Worked on some SQL queries to create, update, delete, query datasets in dbeaver and also access data from multiple datasets based on the relationship between the datasets. These queries include sorting (ORDER BY, GROUP BY), conditional queries (like & where clause,etc), Operators (MIN,MAX,SUM,AVG,COUNT), logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and Joins clause for relational datasets.
